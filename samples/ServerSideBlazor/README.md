# Server-side Blazor with Azure SignalR Service

This sample is to show how to make Server-side Blazor work with Azure SignalR Service.

## Prerequisites
* Install .NET Core 3.0 SDK (Version >= 3.0.100-preview6-012264)

## Provision a SignalR Service

First let's provision a SignalR service on Azure. 
> If you don't have an Azure subscription, **[start now](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)** to create a free account.

1. Open Azure portal, click "Create a resource" and search "SignalR Service".

2. Navigate to "SignalR Service" and click "Create".

3. Fill in basic information including resource name, resource group and location.

   ![signalr-2](../../docs/images/signalr-2.png)

   Resource name will also be used as the DNS name of your service endpoint. So you'll get a `<resource_name>.service.signalr.net` that your application can connect to.

   Select a pricing tier. There're two pricing tiers:
   
   * Free: which can handle 20 connections at the same time and can send and receive 20,000 messages in a day.
   * Standard: which has 1000 concurrent connections and one million messages per day limit for *one unit*. You can scale up to 100 units for a single service instance and you'll be charged by the number of units you use.

4. Click "Create", your SignalR service will be created in a few minutes.

After your service is ready, go to the **Keys** page of your service instance and you'll get two connection strings that your application can use to connect to the service.

## Run the sample

Then let's update Server-side Blazor sample to use the new service you just created.

Set the connection string in the [Secret Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#secret-manager) tool for .NET Core, and run this app.

```
dotnet restore
dotnet user-secrets set Azure:SignalR:ConnectionString "<your connection string>"
dotnet run
```

After running, you will see that the web server starts, makes connections to the Azure SignalR Service instance and creates an endpoint at `https://localhost:5001/`. Browser the page and click F12, you can find the connection to Azure SignalR Service is created. See snapshot

> If you're blocked when visit the localhost endpoint related to `Not secure` or `This site canâ€™t be reached`, it's caused by local cert is not trusted. Run command below to trust the dotnet built-in dev-certs before start the app.
> ```
> dotnet dev-certs https --trust
> ```

## Steps one by one

Let's take a look at each step about how to create this sample app.

1. Create Server-side Blazor project.

```
dotnet new blazorserverside 
```

2. Add reference to Azure SignalR SDK
   
```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.SignalR --version 1.1.0-preview1-10384
```

3. Add a call to Azure SignalR Service in [Startup.cs](Startup.cs)
   
```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
    services.AddServerSideBlazor().AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR();
    ...
}
```

4. Configure Azure SignalR Service `ConnectionString` either in [appsetting.json](appsettings.json) or with [Secret Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#secret-manager) tool

> Notes: Step 3 can be replaced by using hosting startup assemblies to SignalR SDK.
> 
> 1. Add configuration to turn on Azure SignalR Service in [appsetting.json](appsettings.json)
> ```js
>   "Azure": {
>     "SignalR": {
>       "Enabled": true,
>       "ConnectionString": <your-connection-string>
>     }
>   }
> ```
> 
> 2. Assign hosting startup assembly to use Azure SignalR SDK. Edit [launchSettings.json](Properties\launchSettings.json) and add a configuration like below inside `environmentVariables`.
> ```js
> "environmentVariables": {
>     ...,
>     "ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES": "Microsoft.Azure.SignalR"
>   }
> ```
